Hi, I'm Giulio Burgio, a theoretical physicist currently postdoc in [Alvaro Sanchez's Lab](https://sanchezlaboratory.weebly.com) at the Institute of Functional Biology and Genomics, in the historical city of Salamanca, Spain. The complexity of the world seduced me a while ago, and since then I’ve been courting it with statistical physics and network theory—though I don’t expect it to reciprocate.

I obtained a PhD in the Department of Computer Science and Mathematics of the Rovira i Virgili University (Tarragona, Spain) under the supervision of Profs. Alex Arenas and Sergio Gómez. I then spent one year at the Vermont Complex Systems Institute as a postodc in Prof. Juniper Lovato's lab. 

Building a general theory of higher-order (non-dyadic), context-dependent interactions in systems across scales is my main goal for the next future. I have dedicated most of my research to understanding the macroscopic dynamics of social and biological contagion processes, mainly focusing on the effect of higher-order interactions and group structure. I also like to spend some time studying how cooperative traits evolve, particularly in the context of cultural group selection and behavioral economics, for which I got to learn something about evolutionary game theory.
