The complexity of the world seduced me a while ago, and since then I’ve been courting it with statistical physics and network theory—though I don't expect it to reciprocate.

Hi, I'm Giulio Burgio, a theoretical physicist currently postdoc in [Alvaro Sanchez's Lab](https://sanchezlaboratory.weebly.com) at the Institute of Functional Biology and Genomics (CSIC - USAL), in the historical city of Salamanca, Spain. I obtained a PhD in the Department of Computer Science and Mathematics of the Rovira i Virgili University (Tarragona, Spain) under the supervision of Alex Arenas and Sergio Gómez. I then spent one year at the Vermont Complex Systems Institute as a postdoc in Juniper Lovato's lab. 

Building a theory of context-dependent interactions in systems across scales is my main goal for the next future. I have dedicated most of my research to understanding the macroscopic dynamics of social and biological contagion processes, mainly focusing on the effect of higher-order interactions and group structure. I also enjoy spending some time studying how cooperative traits evolve, particularly in the context of cultural group selection and behavioral economics.
